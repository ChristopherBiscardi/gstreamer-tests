# gstreamer Rust tests

anything in bin/ that is `basic-tutorial-{n}.rs` is an official gstreamer tutorial code snippet.

`bin/basic` is a test script putting together some elements into a pipeline and playing them. The intended usage of this is to be built out to introduce the `removesilence` element at some point and otherwise to just test my understanding of gstreamer+Rust.
